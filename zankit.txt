 

The word “pixel” Is really a short form of two words, “picture element”. It's an appropriate name,
since pixels are in fact the elements which make up our digital pictures. Pixels are the building blocks
of any digital photo or image, sort of like how those fancy Lego toys they sell at your local Toys R Us
are really nothing more than a collection of small, individual Lego pieces, or how pieces of a jigsaw
puzzle come together to form a complete picture, yet if you're standing close enough to the puzzle,
you can still see the individual pieces. Pixels make up your digital photos and images in much the
same way.

When you look at a digital photograph on your computer screen, even though it looks like @ normal
photo and you can clearly make out the people and/or objects in the photo, what you're really seeing
is nothing more than a massive collection of colored squares, squares that are normally too small for
your eyes to see them individually, yet when placed side-by-side and above and below each other,
they form a complete image, which is the photograph you're looking at on your screen. What you see
as a photo you took using your digital camera of your family or a recent trip, a sporting event or what-
ever the case may be, is really nothing more than a whole bunch of tiny colored squares.

Ah, yes.. Thank you!

First of all, | would like to express my sincere gratitude to Kudo Hina-Lee
Yang Hwa for helping me become more flexible as a person or as an
actress.

Our drama has actually worked together as one with summer and winter
passing by, so! would like to thank all the staff members and to my dear
actors for giving me all the support | received from them. There are some
people who have been around with me for a while for Hina, and also to
my personal staff who has been right there till the end. | would like to call
every one of them, and | will try to contact them because | feel like | have
just finished.

This is an award that seems to be for Kudo Hina and not for Kim Min Jung,
so! do not have anything bigger to say. With this award, Now it's time to
be content with this form. It's been a long time since I've received one,
but | wasn't been able to get along, but my shoulders are getting a bit
shrugged and feel better.

| will always remain to be an actor who is silent and still on the spot. Thank
you!
